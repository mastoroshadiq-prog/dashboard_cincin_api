# Checkpoint: Executive Report & Dashboard Polish 🚀

## Project State
*   **Version:** V8 Hybrid Engine (Final Polish)
*   **Date:** 2026-01-07
*   **Focus:** Executive Reporting & UX Enhancements

## Key Accomplishments
1.  **Executive Summary Builder:**
    *   Implemented a client-side PDF report generator within the dashboard.
    *   Added **"Strategic Commentary"** logic that mimics the Python backend's intelligence (Automated Risk Status, Financial Projection, Anomaly Detection).
    *   Report allows modular selection of components (Financial, Map, Action Plan, Yield Loss).

2.  **UX Upgrade - Floating Action Button (FAB):**
    *   Replaced the standard "Generate Report" buttons with a **Premium Floating Action Button** in the bottom-right corner.
    *   Designed with a dark theme, pill shape, and pulse animation for high visibility and specialized feel.

3.  **Bug Fixes:**
    *   Fixed critical JS SyntaxErrors related to unescaped script tags in the report generator.
    *   Resolved ReferenceErrors for modal functions.

## Next Steps
*   **Data Integration:** Ensure the "Anomaly Data" in the report pulls real-time stats (currently static placeholder text in JS).
*   **Visual Polish:** Review chart embedding in the PDF report.

## Artifacts
*   `dashboard_cincin_api_INTERACTIVE_FULL_v8_final.html`: The latest production-ready dashboard.
